# TNCode

Experimental data analysis platform investigating ways to allow non-programmers to access tools like R without having to code or run scripts. 
Must be flexible enough to ‘easily’ add functions and custom analysis methods. Also want to be able to ‘plug in modules' written in C# allowing 
access too many other analysis tools.

Implemented in C# with WPF, Prism and AvalonDock,

R integration using Microsoft RTVS, https://github.com/microsoft/rtvs.

Using code and ideas from various projects,
